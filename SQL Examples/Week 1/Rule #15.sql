/*	RULE #15 - Make sure your SQL data files are on correctly configured RAID volumes
	-	Nothing to see here, folks... 
	-	Data files should be on either a RAID 5 or RAID 10 volume
	-	Log files should be on either a RAID 1 or RAID 10 volume
	-	If you can convince the infrastructure guys to do it, you can stick with RAID 1 and SSD drives instead across the board.
